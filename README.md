# Algorithm_SimpleLinearRegression
> Implemented the Simple Linear Regression algorithm over the dataset given below. 
> 
> [Dataset Used For The Algorithm of Simple Linear Regression](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.gamelab.fun/dataset/salary_data.csv).

### Libraries
Used 4 Libraries:
- numpy: To work with the dataset
- pandas: To work with the dataset
- sklearn: To implement Machine Learning Functions
- matplotlib: To visualise the plots


### Objective
- Imported the dataset
- Splitted it into 2 parts: training and testing set
- Visualising both the sets on the graph
- Initializing the regression model and fitting it using training set (both x and y)
- Now using this model, we can predict any values of x depends on y or any values of y depends on x
